\section{Related Work}
Though several classical representations of statistics information described in \cite{hyvarinen2009natural} have already existed, we declare that our approach is quite distinct from those.~The concept ``autoencoder'' was first proposed in \cite{hinton2006reducing} but with only a short introduction, in 2006.~Afterwards, \cite{bengio2007greedy} and \cite{erhan2010does} proclaimed the effectiveness of unsupervised learning algorithm in deep neural networks.~In 2013, it also was applied by \cite{icml2013_cho13} to denoise corrupted images to obtain the latent representation with a better classification performance.~Significant improvement of autoencoder with bilingual sparse features was suggested by \cite{zhao2014autoencoder} for statistical machine translation in 2014.~Moreover, sparse autoencoder was employed as an useful tool for the signature verification that reduced error and increased accuracy by \cite{fayyaz2015online} in 2015.
