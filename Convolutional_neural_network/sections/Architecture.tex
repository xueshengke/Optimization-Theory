\section{Architecture}
Typically convolutional neural network (see Fig.~\ref{fig:CNN}) is composed of pairs of convolution layer and pooling layer with a fully connected layer at the last stage of the architecture.~The input of network is a two-dimensional image and its feedforward process contains convolution and pooling (also subsampling) operations that generate the corresponding layers' feature maps.

After hierarchical feedforward steps, the feature maps before the fully connected layer which have smaller size than primitive input are all concatenated into a long vector.~Considering the classification task, the output of network possesses $k$ units (the class number for discrimination) that are organized as a ``one-of-$k$'' code where only one element of output is positive and the rest of them are either zero or negative depending on the choice of output activation function.~Like other artificial neural networks, CNN has numerous adjustable parameters, namely weights and biases (notation $\bm{W}$ and $\bm{b}$), respectively.~Error backpropagation algorithm which is efficient in multi-layer structure is described below to interpret the approach of updating the parameters concretely.
