\section{Introduction}
Currently, deep learning attracts a great deal of attention especially the researches on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).~Although the initial proposal and application of CNN \cite{lecun1995comparison} was in 1995, convolutional neural network was in silence in last decade as if its development was somehow stuck.~However, convolutional neural network is prevalent as Artificial Intelligence becomes a hot spot in the research area of Computer Science.~This paper discusses the derivation of training approach of CNN concretely.
